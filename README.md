To download the apk on a device, you must allow downloads from unknown sources to be able to install it. It downloads regularly like any other application on Android devices. It is also possible to run the application on Android Studio by first importing the project and opening the project by selecting “weather app” then allowing it to build. There is then a play button that is used to run it and you can then use a virtual device emulator on Android Studio to see the application on Android Studio as well.
